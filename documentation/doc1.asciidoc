----
- **10 m**: contains spectral bands 2, 3, 4, 8, a True Colour Image (TCI), and AOT and WVP maps resampled from 20 m.
- **20 m**: contains spectral bands 1–7, bands 8A, 11, 12, a TCI, a Scene Classification (SCL) map, and AOT/WVP maps. Band 8 is omitted in favor of 8A for spectral precision.
- **60 m**: contains all the spectral bands in the 20 m folder, plus band 9, TCI, SCL map, and AOT/WVP maps. Cirrus band 10 is omitted (no surface info).
== Usage

To use the Python code, follow these steps:

=== 1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
=== 2. In your terminal, run one of the following depending on your environment:

If using a virtual environment:
[source, shell]
----
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

If using a Conda environment:
[source, shell]
----
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
----

=== 3. Open `Script/Sentinel_EE.ipynb` and follow the instructions.

== Conclusion

This repository should help you search and download satellite imagery.
