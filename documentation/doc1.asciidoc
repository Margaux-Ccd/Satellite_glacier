- 10 m: containing spectral bands 2, 3, 4 , 8, a True Colour Image (TCI) and an AOT and WVP maps resampled from 20 m.

- 20 m: containing spectral bands 1 - 7, the bands 8A, 11 and 12, a True Colour Image (TCI), a Scene Classification (SCL) map and an AOT and WVP maps. The band B8 is omitted as B8A provides more precise spectral information.

- 60 m: containing all the spectral bands provided in the 20 m folder, plus the band 9, a True Colour Image (TCI), a Scene Classification (SCL) map and an AOT and WVP maps. The cirrus band 10 is omitted, as it does not contain surface information.
== Sentinel output file architecture

The following schematic illustrates the architecture of the sentinel 2 files .
